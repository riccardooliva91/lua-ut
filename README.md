# Lua-UT
A very simple unit tests framework for LUA. Please note that at this stage **only Windows is supported**.\
\
I created this test suite for personal use because I didn't find something that really suited my needs, plus
I'm not a Lua programmer (I use this just for side projects when I need to). If you see some potential and you want to 
contribute, or if you have suggestions, [contact me](https://github.com/riccardooliva91)!

## Documentation
The docs are available in the [repo's wiki](https://github.com/riccardooliva91/lua-ut/wiki).

## Contributions
I gladly accept PRs and suggestions, if you want to talk you can contact me via email, check my profile for
